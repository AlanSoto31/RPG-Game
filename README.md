    This is an application about a basic 2D Roll Playing Game with heroes moving through a small world, sorting obstacles, and facing enemies. In each battle, you can earn some points if you defeat the enemies, the purpose of the game is to earn as many points as possible. In this case, our hero is a manatee in a sea world facing evil octopuses and jellyfishes. It was developed using the Phaser library.
